          Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. Foxes have a flattened skull,
          upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush).
          <br><br>
          Twelve species belong to the monophyletic "true foxes" group of genus Vulpes. Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always
          or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group,
          which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox. Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. By far the most common
          and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies. The global distribution of foxes,
          together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many
          societies around the world. The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British
          Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.

          Foxes are generally smaller than some other members of the family Canidae such as wolves and jackals, while they may be larger than some
          within the family, such as Raccoon dogs. In the largest species, the red fox, males weigh on average between 4.1 and 8.7 kilograms, while
          the smallest species, the fennec fox, weighs just 0.7 to 1.6 kg. Foxy features typically include a triangular face, pointed ears, an
          elongated rostrum, and a bushy tail. Foxes are digitigrade; they walk on their toes. Unlike most members of the family Canidae, foxes
          have partially retractable claws. Fox vibrissae, or whiskers, are black. The whiskers on the muzzle, mystaciae vibrissae, average 1
          00â€“110 millimetres, while the whiskers everywhere else on the head average to be shorter in length. Whiskers (carpal vibrissae) are
          also on the forelimbs and average 40 mm, pointing downward and backward. Other physical characteristics vary according to habitat and
          adaptive significance.
          <br><br>
          Several fox species are endangered in their native environments. Pressures placed on foxes include habitat loss and being hunted for pelts,
          other trade, or control. Due in part to their opportunistic hunting style and industriousness, foxes are commonly resented as nuisance
          animals. On the other hand, foxes, while often considered pests themselves, have been successfully employed to control pests on fruit
          farms while leaving the fruit intact.
          <br><br>
          Fox species differ in fur color, length, and density. Coat colors range from pearly white to black-and-white to black flecked with white or
          grey on the underside. Fennec foxes (and other species of fox adapted to life in the desert, such as kit foxes), for example, have large
          ears and short fur to aid in keeping the body cool. Arctic foxes, on the other hand, have tiny ears and short limbs as well as thick,
          insulating fur, which aid in keeping the body warm. Red foxes, by contrast, have a typical auburn pelt, the tail normally ending with
          a white marking. A fox's coat color and texture may vary due to the change in seasons; fox pelts are richer and denser in the colder
          months and lighter in the warmer months. To get rid of the dense winter coat, foxes moult once a year around April; the process begins
          from the feet, up the legs, and then along the back. Coat color may also change as the individual ages.
