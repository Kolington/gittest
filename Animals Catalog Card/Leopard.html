          The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the Felidae. It occurs in a wide
          range in sub-Saharan Africa, in small parts of Western and Central Asia, on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia. It is
          listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are
          declining in large parts of the global range. In Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in Morocco,
          leopard populations have already been extirpated. Contemporary records suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical
          global range.
          <br><br>
          Leopards are hunted illegally, and their body parts are smuggled in the wildlife trade for medicinal practices and decoration.Compared
          to other wild cats, the leopard has relatively short legs and a long body with a large skull. Its fur is marked with rosettes. It is
          similar in appearance to the jaguar, but has a smaller, lighter physique, and its rosettes are generally smaller, more densely packed
          and without central spots. Both leopards and jaguars that are melanistic are known as black panthers. The leopard is distinguished by
          its well-camouflaged fur, opportunistic hunting behaviour, broad diet, strength, and its ability to adapt to a variety of habitats
          ranging from rainforest to steppe, including arid and montane areas. It can run at speeds of up to 58 kilometres per hour (36 mph).
          The earliest known leopard fossils excavated in Europe are estimated 600,000 years old, dating to the late Early Pleistocene.
          Leopard fossils were also found in Japan.
          <br><br>
          The leopard's fur is generally soft and thick, notably softer on the belly than on the back. Its skin colour varies between individuals
          from pale yellowish to dark golden with dark spots grouped in rosettes. Its belly is whitish and its ringed tail is shorter than its
          body. Its pupils are round. Leopards living in arid regions are pale cream, yellowish to ochraceous and rufous in colour; those living
          in forests and mountains are much darker and deep golden. Spots fade toward the white underbelly and the insides and lower parts of the
          legs. Rosettes are circular in East African leopard populations, and tend to be squarish in Southern African and larger in Asian
          leopard populations. The fur tends to be grayish in colder climates, and dark golden in rain forest habitats. The pattern of the
          rosettes is unique in each individual.
          <br><br>
          Its fur tends to grow longer in colder climates. The guard hairs protecting the basal hairs are short, 3–4 mm (1/8 – 5/32 in) in face
          and head, and increase in length toward the flanks and the belly to about 25–30 mm. Juveniles have woolly fur, and appear to be
          dark-coloured due to the densely arranged spots. Its white-tipped tail is about 60–100 cm (24–39 in) long, white underneath and
          with spots that form incomplete bands toward the tail's end. The leopard's rosettes differ from those of the jaguar, which are darker
          and with smaller spots inside. The cheetah has small round spots without any rosettes.
          <br><br>
          Like most cat species, the leopard has a diploid chromosome number of 38. The chromosomes include four acrocentric, five metacentric,
          seven submetacentric and two telocentric pairs. The leopard was crossbred with other Panthera species in zoos. In 1953, a lioness
          and a male leopard were mated in Hanshin Park in Nishinomiya, Japan. The first litter from this pair was born in November 1959,
          consisting of a male and a female. Another litter was born in 1961, in which all the offspring were spotted and bigger than a
          juvenile leopard. This hybrid came to be known as a leopon. Unsuccessful attempts were made to mate a leopon with a tigress.
