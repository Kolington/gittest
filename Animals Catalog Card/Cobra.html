          The king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), also known as the hamadryad, is a venomous snake species in the family Elapidae, endemic to forests
          from India through Southeast Asia. It is threatened by habitat destruction and has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since
          2010. It is the world's longest venomous snake. Adult king cobras are 3.18 to 4m (10.4 to 13.1ft) long. The longest known individual
          measured 5.85 m (19.2 ft). It is the sole member of the genus Ophiophagus. It preys chiefly on other snakes and occasionally on some
          other vertebrates, such as lizards and rodents. It is a highly venomous and dangerous snake when agitated or provoked that has a fearsome
          reputation in its range, although it is typically shy and avoids confrontation with humans when possible. The king cobra is a prominent
          symbol in the mythology and folk traditions of India, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. It is the national reptile of India.
          <br><br>
          Ophiophagus hannah was accepted as the valid name for the king cobra by Charles Mitchill Bogert in 1945 who argued that it differs
          significantly from Naja species. A genetic analysis using cytochrome b, and a multigene analysis showed that the king cobra was an
          early offshoot of a genetic lineage giving rise to the mambas, rather than the Naja cobras.

          The king cobra's skin is olive green with black and white bands on the trunk that converge to the head. The head is covered by 15 drab
          coloured and black edged shields. The muzzle is rounded, and the tongue black. It has two fangs and 3â€“5 maxillar teeth in the upper jaw,
          and two rows of teeth in the lower jaw. The nostrils are between two shields. The large eyes have a golden iris and round pupils. Its
          hood is oval shaped and covered with olive green smooth scales and two black spots between the two lowest scales. Its cylindrical tail
          is yellowish green above and marked with black. It has a pair of large occipital scales on top of the head, 17 to 19 rows of smooth
          oblique scales on the neck, and 15 rows on the body. Juveniles are black with chevron shaped white, yellow or buff bars that point
          towards the head. Adult king cobras are 3.18 to 4 m (10.4 to 13.1 ft) long. The longest known individual measured 5.85 m (19.2 ft).
          Ventral scales are uniformly oval shaped. Dorsal scales are placed in an oblique arrangement.

          The king cobra has a wide distribution in South and Southeast Asia. It occurs up to an elevation of 2,000 m (6,600 ft) from the Terai
          in India and southern Nepal to the Brahmaputra River basin in Bhutan and northeast India, Bangladesh and to Myanmar, southern China,
          Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines. In northern India, it has been recorded in
          Garhwal and Kumaon, and in the Shivalik and terai regions of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. In northeast India, the king cobra has
          been recorded in northern West Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram. In the Eastern
          Ghats, it occurs from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh to coastal Odisha, and also in Bihar and southern West Bengal, especially the
          Sunderbans. In the Western Ghats, it was recorded in Kerala, Karnataka and Maharashtra, and also in Gujarat. It also occurs on
          Baratang Island in the Great Andaman chain.
          <br><br>
          The king cobra's diet consists primarily of other snakes and lizards, including Indian cobra, banded krait, rat snake, pythons,
          green whip snake, keelback, banded wolf snake and Blyth's reticulated snake. It also hunts Malabar pit viper and hump-nosed
          pit viper by following their odour trails. In Singapore, one was observed swallowing a clouded monitor. When food is
          scarce, it also feeds on other small vertebrates, such as birds, and lizards. In some cases, the cobra constricts its prey using its
          muscular body, though this is uncommon. After a large meal, it lives for many months without another one because of its slow metabolic
          rate.
