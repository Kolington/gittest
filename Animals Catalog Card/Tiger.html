           The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its
           dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as
           deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat,
           which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before
           they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.
           <br><br>
            The tiger once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin, and in the south from the
            foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda islands. Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93%
            of their historic range and have been extirpated in Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas
            of Southeast and South Asia and China. Today's tiger range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical
            and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent and Sumatra.
           <br><br>
            The tiger is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between
            3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in small pockets isolated from each other. India currently
            hosts the largest tiger population. Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching.
            Tigers are also victims of humanâ€“wildlife conflict in particular in range countries with a high human population density.
           <br><br>
            The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna. It featured prominently in ancient mythology
            and folklore and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for
            sporting teams. The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea.
           <br><br>
           The tiger has a muscular body with powerful forelimbs, a large head and a tail that is about half the length of its body. Its pelage is
           dense and heavy, and colouration varies between shades of orange and brown with white ventral areas and distinctive vertical black
           stripes that are unique in each individual. Stripes are likely advantageous for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with
           strong vertical patterns of light and shade. The tiger is one of only a few striped cat species; it is not known why spotted patterns
           and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among felids. The orangish colour may also aid in camouflage as the tiger's prey
           are dichromats, and thus may perceive the cat as green and blended in with the vegetation.
          <br><br>
           A tiger's coat pattern is still visible when it is shaved. This is not due to skin pigmentation, but to the stubble and hair follicles
           embedded in the skin, similar to human beards (colloquially five o'clock shadow), and is in common with other big cats. They have a
           mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males. The pupils are circular with yellow
           irises. The small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the back, surrounded by black. These spots are thought to play an
           important role in intraspecific communication.
