          Zebras are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three extant species: the Grévy's zebra
          (Equus grevyi), plains zebra (E. quagga) and the mountain zebra (E. zebra). Their stripes come in different patterns, unique
          to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes, with most evidence supporting them
          as a form of protection from biting flies. Zebras share the genus Equus with horses and asses, and together they are the only
          living members of the family Equidae. Zebras belong to the subgenus Hippotigris. They inhabit eastern and southern Africa and
          can be found in a variety of habitats such as savannahs, grasslands, woodlands, shrublands and mountainous areas.
          <br><br>
          Zebras are primarily grazers and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly by lions and typically flee when
          threatened but also bite and kick. Zebra species differ in social behaviour, with plains and mountain zebra living in stable harems
          consisting of an adult male or stallion, several adult females or mares, and their young or foals; while Grévy's zebra live alone
          or in loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male Grévy's
          zebras establish territories which attract females and the species is promiscuous. Zebras communicate with various vocalisations,
          body postures and facial expressions. Social grooming strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras.
          <br><br>
          A zebra's dazzling stripes make them among the most recognisable mammals. They have been featured in art and stories in Africa and
          beyond. Historically, they have been highly sought after by exotic animal collectors, but unlike horses and donkeys, zebras have
          never been truly domesticated. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the Grévy's zebra as endangered,
          the mountain zebra as vulnerable and the plains zebra as near-threatened. The quagga, a type of plains zebra, was driven to
          extinction in the 19th century. Nevertheless, zebras can be found in numerous protected areas.
          <br><br>
          Fertile hybrids have been reported in the wild between plains and Grévy's zebra. Hybridisation has also been recorded between the
          plains and mountain zebra, though it is possible that these are infertile due to the difference in chromosome numbers between the
          two species. Captive zebras have been bred with horses and donkeys; these are known as zebroids. A zorse is a cross between a zebra
          and a horse; a zonkey between a zebra and a donkey and a zoni between a zebra and a pony. Zebroids are usually infertile and may
          suffer from dwarfism.
          <br><br>
          As with all wild equines, zebra have barrel-chested bodies with tufted tails, elongated faces and long necks with long, erect manes.
          Their elongated, slender legs end in a single spade-shaped toe covered in a hard hoof. Their dentition is adapted for grazing; they
          have large incisors that clip grass blades and highly crowned, ridged molars well suited for grinding. Males have spade-shaped canines,
          which can be used as weapons in fighting. Zebras have fairly good senses. The eyes are at the sides and far up the head, which allows
          them to see above the tall grass while grazing. Their moderately long, erect ears are movable and can locate the source of a sound.
          <br><br>
          Unlike horses, zebras and asses have chestnuts only on their front limbs. In contrast to other living equines, zebra forelimbs are
          longer than their back limbs. Diagnostic traits of the zebra skull include: its relatively small size with a straight profile, more
          projected eye sockets, narrower rostrum, reduced postorbital bar, a V-shaped groove separating the metaconid and metastylid of the
          teeth and both halves of the enamel wall being rounded.
