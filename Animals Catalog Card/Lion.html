          The lion (Panthera leo) is a species in the family Felidae and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its muscular,
          deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions
          have a prominent mane. With a typical head-to-body length of 184–208 cm (72–82 in) they are larger than females at 160–184 cm (63–72 in).
          It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Groups of
          female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions
          scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.
          <br><br>
          Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other big cats,
          but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. In the Pleistocene, the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa
          and North America, but today it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered
          population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries
          have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause
          of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
          <br><br>
          In zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids for the curiosity of visitors or for scientific purpose. The liger is bigger
          than a lion and a tiger, whereas most tigons are relatively small compared to their parents because of reciprocal gene effects. The leopon
          is a hybrid between a lion and leopard. Of the living felid species, the lion is rivaled only by the tiger in length, weight and height at
          the shoulder.Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, and
          has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of skull variation in the
          two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.

          The male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species. It may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago. It
          starts growing when lions are about a year old. Mane colour varies and darkens with age; research shows its colour and size are influenced
          by environmental factors such as average ambient temperature. Mane length apparently signals fighting success in male–male relationships;
          darker-maned individuals may have longer reproductive lives and higher offspring survival, although they suffer in the hottest months of
          the year. The presence, absence, colour and size of the mane are associated with genetic precondition, sexual maturity, climate and
          testosterone production; the rule of thumb is that a darker, fuller mane indicates a healthier animal. In Serengeti National Park,
          female lions favour males with dense, dark manes as mates. Cool ambient temperature in European and North American zoos may
          result in a heavier mane. Asiatic lions usually have sparser manes than average African lions.
