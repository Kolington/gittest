          Crocodiles (subfamily Crocodylinae) or true crocodiles are large semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in Africa, Asia,
          the Americas and Australia. Crocodylinae, all of whose members are considered true crocodiles, is classified as a biological subfamily.
          A broader sense of the term crocodile, Crocodylidae that includes Tomistoma, is not used in this article. The term crocodile here applies
          to only the species within the subfamily of Crocodylinae. The term is sometimes used even more loosely to include all extant members of
          the order Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae),
          and all other living and fossil Crocodylomorpha.
          <br><br>
          Although they appear similar, crocodiles, alligators and the gharial belong to separate biological families. The gharial, with its narrow
          snout, is easier to distinguish, while morphological differences are more difficult to spot in crocodiles and alligators. The most obvious
          external differences are visible in the head, with crocodiles having narrower and longer heads, with a more V-shaped than a U-shaped snout
          compared to alligators and caimans. Another obvious trait is that the upper and lower jaws of the crocodiles are the same width, and the
          teeth in the lower jaw fall along the edge or outside the upper jaw when the mouth is closed; therefore, all teeth are visible, unlike an
          alligator, which possesses in the upper jaw small depressions into which the lower teeth fit. Also, when the crocodile's mouth is closed,
          the large fourth tooth in the lower jaw fits into a constriction in the upper jaw. For hard-to-distinguish specimens, the protruding tooth
          is the most reliable feature to define the species' family. Crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better
          tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. Another
          trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.
          <br><br>
          Crocodile size, morphology, behaviour and ecology differ somewhat among species. However, they have many similarities in these areas as well.
          All crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water
          and saltwater. They are carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and sometimes on
          invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species and age. All crocodiles are tropical species that, unlike alligators,
          are very sensitive to cold. They separated from other crocodilians during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago. Many species are
          at the risk of extinction, some being classified as critically endangered.
          <br><br>
          A crocodile's physical traits allow it to be a successful predator. Its external morphology is a sign of its aquatic and predatory lifestyle.
          Its streamlined body enables it to swim swiftly; it also tucks its feet to the side while swimming, making it faster by decreasing water
          resistance. Crocodiles have webbed feet which, though not used to propel them through the water, allow them to make fast turns and sudden
          moves in the water or initiate swimming. Webbed feet are an advantage in shallow water, where the animals sometimes move around by walking.
          Crocodiles have a palatal flap, a rigid tissue at the back of the mouth that blocks the entry of water. The palate has a special path from
          the nostril to the glottis that bypasses the mouth. The nostrils are closed during submergence.
          <br><br>
          Like other archosaurs, crocodilians are diapsid, although their post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The walls of the braincase are bony but
          lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones. Their tongues are not free, but held in place by a membrane that limits movement; as a result,
          crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues. Crocodiles have smooth skin on their bellies and sides, while their dorsal surfaces
          are armoured with large osteoderms. The armoured skin has scales and is thick and rugged, providing some protection. They are still able
          to absorb heat through this armour, as a network of small capillaries allows blood through the scales to absorb heat. The osteoderms are
          highly vascularised and aid in calcium balance, both to neutralize acids while the animal cannot breathe underwater and to provide
          calcium for eggshell formation. Crocodilian scales have pores believed to be sensory in function, analogous to the lateral line in
          fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily
          substance which appears to flush mud off.
